# Format:
# package_name==version # req-1, req-2, req-3!ext
# `pip install ptb-raw[req-1/2]` will install `package_name`
# `pip install ptb[req-1/2/3]` will also install `package_name`

# Make sure to install those as additional_dependencies in the
# pre-commit hooks for pylint & mypy
# Also update the readme accordingly

# When dependencies release new versions and tests succeed, we should try to expand the allowed
# versions and only increase the lower bound if necessary

httpx[socks] # socks
cryptography!=3.4,!=3.4.1,!=3.4.2,!=3.4.3,>=3.0 # passport
aiolimiter~=1.0.0 # rate-limiter!ext

# tornado is rather stable, but let's not allow the next mayor release without prior testing
tornado~=6.2 # webhooks!ext

# Cachetools and APS don't have a strict stability policy.
# Let's be cautious for now.
cachetools~=5.3.0 # callback-data!ext
APScheduler~=3.10.1 # job-queue!ext

# pytz is required by APS and just needs the lower bound due to #2120
pytz>=2018.6 # job-queue!ext
